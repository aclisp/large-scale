Compile Time Assertions in C

Introduction

C has a facility for checking dynamic assertions at run-time. It's inside <a
ssert.h> and its called assert. Now assert is a macro, so why isn't it calle
d ASSERT? I don't know. Prior art no doubt. Anyway, assert is a dynamic runt
ime feature, you can only use it inside functions.

/* not inside a function, won't compile :-( */

assert(sizeof(int) * CHAR_BIT >= 32);

That's a pity because it would be nice if I could get the compiler to check
things like this automatically at compile time. I've occasionally seen an at
tempt at a compile-time check like this...

#if sizeof(int) * CHAR_BIT < 32

#error People of Earth. Your attention please...

#endif

But this doesn't work. The C preprocessor is a glorified text reformatter: i
t knows practically nothing about C. However, there is a way to write this a
s a compile time assertion (and moving any error trap to an earlier phase is
 a Good Thing)

{ yourself }

#define COMPILE_TIME_ASSERT(expr)   \

    char constraint[expr]

COMPILE_TIME_ASSERT(sizeof(int) * CHAR_BIT >= 32);

What's is going on here? Well, the example preprocesses to...

char constraint[sizeof(int) * CHAR_BIT >= 32];

If the expression is true, (an int is at least 32 bits), the expression will
 have a value of one, and constraint will be an array of one char. If the as
sertion is false, (an int is less than 32 bits), the expression will have a
value of zero, and constraint will be an empty array. That's illegal, and yo
u'll get a compile time error. Viola, a compile time assertion :-) You can u
se it inside and outside a function but you can't use it twice in the same f
unction, as you end up with a duplicate definition. To solve that problem yo
u could resort to some convoluted macro trickery:

#define COMPILE_TIME_ASSERT(expr)       char UNIQUE_NAME[expr]

#define UNIQUE_NAME                     MAKE_NAME(__LINE__)

#define MAKE_NAME(line)                 MAKE_NAME2(line)

#define MAKE_NAME2(line)                constraint_ ## line

But this is pretty horrible. Also, you will probably get warnings about unus
ed variables. Take a step back for a moment and think about why it works at
all. It's because you have to specify the size of an array as a compile time
 constant. The formal grammar of a direct-declarator tells you this. Let's l
ook at some bits of grammar more closely:

Constrained arrays

        direct-declarator:

                identifier

                ( declarator )

                direct-declarator [ constant-expression opt ]

                direct-declarator ( parameter-type-list )

                direct-declarator ( identifier-list opt )

I just piggy backed on this, using the constraint that the value of the cons
tant expression cannot (in this context) be zero. A natural question (to the
 curious) is are there other parts of the formal grammar that require a cons
tant expression. The answer, of course, is yes.

Constrained enums

        enumerator:

                enumeration-constant

                enumeration-constant = constant-expression

However, I can't use this because there are no useful constraints in this co
ntext.

Constrained bit-fields

        struct-declarator:

                declarator

                declarator opt : constant-expression

Reading the constraints of a bit field I see that if the width of a bit-fiel
d is zero the declaration cannot have a declarator. In other words this is l
egal...

        struct x { unsigned int : 0; }

but this is not...

        struct x { unsigned int bf : 0; }

This suggests another way to create a compile time assertion

#define COMPILE_TIME_ASSERT(expr)   \

    struct x { unsigned int bf : expr; }

COMPILE_TIME_ASSERT(sizeof(int) * CHAR_BIT >= 32);

Trying this we again get duplicate definitions, not of a variable this time,
 but of the type struct x. However we can fix this by creating an anonymous
struct:

#define COMPILE_TIME_ASSERT(expr)   \

    struct { unsigned int bf : expr; }

This works. However, now you'll probably get warnings about the unused untag
ged struct.

There is one last bit of grammar that uses a constant-expression.

Constrained switch

        labelled-statement:

                identifier : statement

                case constant-expression : statement

                default : statement

It's well known that you can't have two case labels with the same constant.
The following will not compile...

switch (0)

{

case 0:

case 0:;

}

So, here's yet another way to create a compile time assertion. This time we
don't create a dummy variable, or a dummy type, but a dummy statement. A dum
my switch statement:

#define COMPILE_TIME_ASSERT(pred)       \

    switch(0){case 0:case pred:;}

COMPILE_TIME_ASSERT(sizeof(int) * CHAR_BIT >= 32);

If pred evaluates to true (i.e., 1) then the case labels will be 0 and 1. Di
fferent; Ok. If pred evaluates to false (i.e., 0) then the case labels will
be 0 and 0. The same; Compile time error. Viola. However, a switch statement
 cannot exist in the global scope. So the last piece of the puzzle is to put
 the compile time assertions inside a function.

#include <limits.h>

#define COMPILE_TIME_ASSERT(pred)            \

    switch(0){case 0:case pred:;}

#define ASSERT_MIN_BITSIZE(type, size)       \

    COMPILE_TIME_ASSERT(sizeof(type) * CHAR_BIT >= size)

#define ASSERT_EXACT_BITSIZE(type, size)     \

    COMPILE_TIME_ASSERT(sizeof(type) * CHAR_BIT == size)

void compile_time_assertions(void)

{

    ASSERT_MIN_BITSIZE(char,  8);

    ASSERT_MIN_BITSIZE(int,  16);

    ASSERT_EXACT_BITSIZE(long, 32);

}

That's all for now.

Cheers
